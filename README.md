# jQuery-Selectors-and-Events2
the original broke...

This app allows a user to see pictures on a screen then select a name from a drop down to see only that picture. The user can also click on a sorting radio button to sort by either horn or name.

Worked on by Anthony Beaver and Henry Funk. Collaborated with Brandon Gonzalez.
